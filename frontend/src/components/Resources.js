                    <p>Upon bringing your new houseplant home, inspect the leaves before bringing them indoors. If they show signs of pests or disease, keep them isolated and cure the problem before you infect your other indoor plants. Expect new plants to drop some leaves. When bringing them into your home, some plants will show signs of shock as you move them from one environment to a new one - especially if light levels in your home are significantly different. Avoid placing plants in areas where temperatures fluctuate or stay too hot or cold. Provide the right amount of light that your plant requires. Some may require bright direct sunlight while others prefer a north-facing window with minimal amounts of bright light.</p>

                    <p>Each species of houseplants require different amounts of light and water. You are responsible for doing your own research as to what those specific requirements are. As a rule of thumb, water your plant when the soil is dry in the area beneath the soil near the roots. This will help you determine the correct watering routine for that plant. Healthy plants will be able to ward off pests and disease much better than weak plants.</p>

                    <p>For indoor care, inspect the leaves for any diseases the plant might have. The most common cause for a dying succulent is root rot. Be sure to plant your suculent in a pot that drains. Succulents do not like to live in wet soil. They are accustomed to high temperatures and minimal moisture so wet soil can rot their roots and kill the plant. Using the correct type of soil can hekp your new succulent thrive. Using a soil that drains well will keep your plants appropriately moist. Succulents hail from hot, dry climates and love plenty of sunlight. Although they will go dormant in the winter and require less sunlight, most succulents like at least a half day to a full day of sunlight depending on what type of plant you have purchased. Most importantly, water heavily but not often. Again, overwatering is the most common people experience when it comes to succulents. Always check the soil in between waterings.   </p>

                    <p>For outdoor care, choose a sunny spot that will give your succulent lots of natural sunlight. Like all succulents, be sure that the soil drains will. If planting in an outdoor garden, choose your succulents and accompanying plants carefully. Succulenets prefer dry soil whereas most garden plants require more frequent waterings. If the accompanying plants do not require the same care, consider moving your succulents to another location or moving them indoors. Most succulents do not fare well in the winter season so if you are in an area with cold winters, consider moving them indoors until the spring/summer months. </p>
